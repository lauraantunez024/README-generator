## Description

ReadMes can take a lot of time, and since every good project requires one, this app will shorten the amount of time it takes to format a readme, so that the user can spend more time focusing on the code and the project itself.

## Installation

Add the files to your local environment by git cloning into a folder

## Usage
Answer prompts and once completed, a formatted readme file with user responses will appear in the folder
